## People Flow Detection

This project aims to detect the flow of people in an environment using a streaming camera, using the YOLOv5 and OpenCV libraries in Python.
Functioning

The system simulates a streaming camera using a virtual machine, taking a single video as input. Using the YOLOv5 library, the program detects people in the video, and then counts the flow of people in and out of a pre-determined area. The information is displayed on a simple and objective graph on the screen.

#### Development Stages

- Definition of use case
- Logical thinking
- Creation of functions and implementation in code
- Preparation of presentation slides

#### Quality Criteria

- Simplicity: Results are displayed on a simple and objective graph on the screen.
- Functionality: Proper detection of objects of interest.
- Usability: Availability of displays showing the occupancy of various locations on campus.

#### Future Work

The project can be used in various locations such as:

- Banks, to determine how many people are waiting in line and an estimated time of the next service.
- Public transportation, to determine if a bus or train carriage is full.
- Numerous other places, as the project can be used in almost any location with either low or high traffic of people.

#### Limitations

The system only simulates a streaming camera and receives only one video. Detection may fail in situations with a high number of objects or objects very close together. The accuracy of detection may be affected by noise in the environment.

#### Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV

#### How to Run the Project

- Install Python and the YOLOv5 and OpenCV libraries.
- Clone this repository.
- Run the main.py file.
